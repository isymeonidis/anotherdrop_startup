AnotherDrop Startup is a distribution based on Drupal version 7.
Using AnotherDrop Startup helps you save time in creating a drupal website.
It started as a personal project in order to fill the need for a
ready-to-use basic drupal website with basic modules and
configuration.

AnotherDrop Startup is suited for advanced developers as it offers the
platform to begin directly configuring and seting up  a drupal
website, starting from a level where basic tasks have been already
completed.

It is also suited for those who work with Drupal for the first time
since it provides a small, integrated and flexible website either for
testing and learning or developing a professional website.
